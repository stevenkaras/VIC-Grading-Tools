Description
===========================================================
This project is the result of a week of boredom between semesters. I wrote it to rapidly test VIC,
a simplified computing model developed by Prof. Shimon Schocken and Mr. Yotam Harchol.

Caveat Emptor
===========================================================
Currently, the project is not in good condition, lacks proper documentation and has a horrible API.
Also, it doesn't have a GUI. These are things that are in the works, and hopefully will be finished
by October 2010.

Usage
===========================================================
Run the CLI, passing a parameter for the path to the directory which contains each students programs
and the testsuite definitions. I will add an example directory with the next version.
